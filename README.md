# social-media-thing
(name and project wip)

online version (at least for now): https://trinkey.pythonanywhere.com
## wtf is this and why did you make it
it's like twitter but bad basically, i made it because im really bored

## how to use
1. download the files from the directory either using git or the website
2. make a new file in the base directory called `_api_keys.py`
3. in that file, put the following code:
```py
auth_key = "put a random string here"
```
4. run the `_server.py` file (make sure you have the flask library installed), then go to localhost (specify port if needed), after that everything should work on it's own
