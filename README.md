(name and project wip)

online version (at least for now): https://trinkey.pythonanywhere.com
## wtf is this and why did you make it
it's like twitter but bad basically, i made it because im really bored

## how tf do i use this
1. download the files from the directory either using git or the website
2. make a new file in the base directory called `_api_keys.py`
3. in that file, put the following code:
```py
auth_key = b"put some random text here"
```
4. run the `_server.py` file (make sure you have python and the flask library installed)
5. on your web browser go to the url `localhost` (specify port if needed, don't add the `www.` or `https://` part)
6. after that everything should work on it's own, make sure to report any features or suggestions

## where can i report issues or suggest stuff
go to the [issues tab](https://github.com/trinkey/social-media-thing) and make a new issue (make sure you're logged in with github)
